To determine whether or not a subscription currently provides access to any associated entitlements, use the _gives_access_ field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Possible values:&lt;br&gt;• `trialing`: the subscription is in a free trial period&lt;br&gt;• `active`: the subscription is active, in a paid period&lt;br&gt;• `expired`: the subscription is expired and no longer active&lt;br&gt;• `in_grace_period`: the subscription is past its regular expiry date and experienced a billing issue, but is currently still in an access-granting grace period&lt;br&gt;• `in_billing_retry`: the subscription has experienced a billing issue. Billing is being retried, access is suspended.-paused: the subscription is currently paused and should not provide access.&lt;br&gt;• `unknown`: the subscription is in an unknown state. Refer to the _gives_access_ field to determine whether or not to grant access.&lt;br&gt;• `incomplete`: the subscription is in an incomplete state, maybe due to incorrect billing details or because it&apos;s scheduled to start in the future.</summary>
