# LiftLog Roadmap

A rough idea of what's on my mind for LiftLog. This is a side project built in my spare time, so no guarantees on timelines or if things will actually happen — it all depends on motivation and available time!

Priorities shift based on what feels fun to work on, community interest, and how complex something turns out to be.
