<p>
  We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy
  (&#8220;Policy&#8221;). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide
  (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;) in the &#8220;LiftLog&#8221; mobile application (&#8220;Mobile Application&#8221;
  or &#8220;Service&#8221;) and any of its related products and services (collectively, &#8220;Services&#8221;), and our
  practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes

<h2 id="collection-of-information">Collection of information</h2>
<p>
  Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may process only minimal
  user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Mobile Application and Services. Information
  collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information
  regarding the usage of the Mobile Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated
  in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
</p>
<h2 id="privacy-of-children">Privacy of children</h2>
<p>
  We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of
  13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. If you have reason to
  believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Mobile Application and
  Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child&#8217;s Personal Information from our Services.
</p>
<p>
  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&#8217;s Internet usage and to help enforce this
  Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services
  without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the
  necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online
  without their permission.
</p>
<h2 id="use-and-processing-of-collected-information">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
<p>
  We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a
  data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.
</p>
<p>
  Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of
  a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use
  of the Mobile Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes
  and means of the processing of Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
  We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Mobile
  Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such
  Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing
  Personal Information acts as a data controller.
</p>
<p>
  In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to
  collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be
  able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used to
  help us run and operate the Mobile Application and Services.
</p>
<p>
  Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile Application and Services, where you
  are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific
  purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
  pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you
  are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
  official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
  us or by a third party.
</p>
<p>
  Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by
  opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to
  clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal
  Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
</p>
<h2 id="disclosure-of-information">Disclosure of information</h2>
<p>
  Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have
  requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers
  (collectively, &#8220;Service Providers&#8221;) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Mobile Application and
  Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies
  with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.
</p>
<p>
  Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on
  our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to
  perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information
  for their own marketing or other purposes. We will share and disclose your information only with the following
  categories of Service Providers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cloud computing services</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to
  comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
  protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government
  request.
</p>
<h2 id="retention-of-information">Retention of information</h2>
<p>
  We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary until the purchase order or Services are
  fulfilled, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted
  by law.
</p>
<p>
  We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it,
  but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall
  be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data
  portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
</p>
<h2 id="links-to-other-resources">Links to other resources</h2>
<p>
  The Mobile Application and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be
  aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you
  to be aware when you leave the Mobile Application and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every
  resource that may collect Personal Information.
</p>
<h2 id="information-security">Information security</h2>
<p>
  We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized
  access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to
  protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and
  custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and
  privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and
  all information and data exchanged between you and the Mobile Application and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii)
  any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.
</p>
<h2 id="data-breach">Data breach</h2>
<p>
  In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and Services has been compromised or
  Users&#8217; Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
  including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate
  measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with
  law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
  individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice
  is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in the Mobile Application.
</p>
<h2 id="changes-and-amendments">Changes and amendments</h2>
<p>
  We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Mobile Application and Services at any time at
  our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to
  you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.
</p>
<p>
  An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless
  otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application and Services after the effective date of the revised
  Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not,
  without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time
  your Personal Information was collected.
</p>
<h2 id="acceptance-of-this-policy">Acceptance of this policy</h2>
<p>
  You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the
  Mobile Application and Services and submitting your information you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not
  agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Mobile Application and
  Services. This privacy policy was created with the help of
