strong Privacy Policy

p
  | Liam Morrow built the LiftLog app as an open source application. This Service is provided by Liam Morrow at no cost
  | and is intended for use as is.

p
  | This page informs users of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when
  | using the LiftLog Service.

p
  | By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  | Personal information is used solely to provide and improve the Service and is not shared except as described here.

p
  strong Information Collection and Use

p
  | For a better experience, I may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your name
  | and workout data. Workout data is stored on your device and, if you choose to enable syncing or sharing, on
  | servers solely to facilitate those features.

p
  | Workout data is encrypted end to end on the client. Encryption keys are generated and stored only on your device
  | and are not transmitted to LiftLog servers. LiftLog does not have access to encryption keys and cannot decrypt,
  | read, or interpret workout content stored or transmitted through the Service.

p
  | LiftLog servers only process encrypted data blobs and limited metadata (such as account identifiers and timestamps)
  | necessary to provide syncing and sharing features.

p
  | Only you and the people you explicitly choose to share workouts with can decrypt and view your workout data.

p
  strong Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

p
  | LiftLog processes personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where applicable.
  | The legal bases for processing are:

ul
  li Consent, for optional features such as crash reporting and the AI Chat Planner.
  li Performance of a contract, to provide core app functionality requested by the user, including workout syncing and sharing.
  li Legitimate interests, to maintain, secure, and improve the Service, such as diagnosing errors and ensuring system reliability.

p
  | Where special category data (such as workout information) may be involved, processing occurs only at the user’s
  | request and under the safeguards described below.

div
  p
    | The app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

p
  strong Log Data

p
  | In the event of an app error, I collect diagnostic information through third-party services. This log data may
  | include your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration,
  | and the time and date of use.

p
  | Log data does not include workout content, encryption keys, or any end-to-end encrypted user data.

p
  strong Pro Version – AI Chat Planner

p
  | The Pro version of LiftLog includes an AI Chat Planner feature. When you use this feature, the messages you send
  | and any workout context you choose to include are transmitted to OpenAI to generate responses.

p
  | Data sent to the AI Chat Planner is not end-to-end encrypted, as it must be readable by OpenAI in order to
  | generate a response. No data is sent to OpenAI unless you actively use this feature.

p
  | You should avoid including sensitive personal information unless necessary for your request. OpenAI acts as an
  | independent service provider and processes this data in accordance with its own privacy policy.

  strong Cookies

p
  | LiftLog does not use cookies directly. However, third-party libraries and services used by the app may use similar
  | technologies to provide functionality, analytics, or error reporting.

p
  strong Service Providers

p
  | I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following purposes:

ul
  li To facilitate the Service
  li To provide the Service on my behalf
  li To perform Service-related services
  li To assist in analyzing how the Service is used

p
  | These third parties may have access to personal information only to perform tasks on my behalf and are obligated
  | not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

p
  strong Data Retention

p
  | Personal information is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the Service and fulfill the purposes
  | outlined in this Privacy Policy.

  strong European Economic Area (EEA) Users

p
  | LiftLog is operated from Australia and is made available globally through app stores, including to users in the
  | European Economic Area (EEA). The Service is not specifically targeted at any particular EU Member State.

p
  | If you are located in the EEA, you have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal
  | data, and to object to or restrict certain processing activities, in accordance with applicable data protection law.

p
  strong Security

p
  | I value your trust in providing personal information and strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
  | it. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and absolute
  | security cannot be guaranteed.

p
  strong Links to Other Sites

p
  | The Service may contain links to external sites. I am not responsible for the content or privacy practices of
  | these third-party sites and encourage you to review their privacy policies.

  | children under 13. If such information is discovered, it will be deleted promptly.

  | I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page, and you are advised to
  | review it periodically.
